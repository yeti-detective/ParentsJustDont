# ParentsJustDont

# In west Philadelphia born and raised, etc

# I work at a place where they think you have to print an email onto paper to read it. I'm 34, but I'm the youngest employee.

# Shortly after I started, I was in a meeting with the sales manager. He said something so out-of-touch that I wished I had a button I could press that would play a record scratch and then "Parents just don't understand" from the eponymous Fresh Prince song.

# Thus was born... this app
